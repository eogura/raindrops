**Raindrops Game, well, not really**

Raindrops Game is a game where the player has to catch falling yarn balls with a kitten. Each yarn ball is 1 point that is added to the score on the top left corner of the display. The player starts with three lives, if they miss a certain number of yarn balls, then they lose a life. 


Glitches/Problems:
There is an error that appears at the botttom of the code, but it does not seem to affect the game
The timer does not serve its original purpose
When caught, the yarnball might flash on the bottom of the display (this may happen when it's not caught too)
When the game is reset, the start button does not work on the start screen
